imagine selling before the real pump
lost my wallet again, found three more instead
bears hibernate, my profits compound
getting lost in profits again
imagine paying attention to red candles
imagine thinking this is the top. amateur hour
market sentiment weaker than your hands
your bags need more discipline
got tired of watching charts, started moving them
imagine following signals. be the signal
imagine following the crowd. pathetic
got lost searching for the dip, found your liquidation
your exit strategy needs more training
your fud is lighter than my morning warmup
